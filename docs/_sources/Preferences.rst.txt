To open the Preferences dialog, click *Edit* > *Preferences*.

**Note:** Some settings will require you to relaunch PixelMaestro Studio (or just load a new Maestro) before applying.

Maestro Options
---------------

The *Maestro Options* let you configure the behavior of the Maestro and PixelMaestro Studio.

Sections
^^^^^^^^

*Sections* sets the number of Sections assigned to the Maestro. Sections are displayed in the top half of the main window in order from left to right.

Pause on Start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When checked, *Pause on start* automatically opens the Maestro in a paused state. This is useful if you want to create a Show from scratch, but don't want the timer running in the background. You can resume playback at any time by clicking the play/pause button in the center of the window.

Save Session on Close
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Save session on close* saves your Maestro configuration when you exit PixelMaestro Studio. This configuration is automatically loaded the next time you open the program.

Rendering Options
-----------------

*Rendering Options* control how the Maestro is displayed on the screen.

Pixel Shape
^^^^^^^^^^^

*Pixel shape* changes the shape of each individual pixel.

**Tip:** For best performance, set the pixel shape to *Square*.

Refresh Interval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Refresh Interval* is the amount of time (in milliseconds) between Maestro refreshes. A lower refresh interval provides smoother animations at the cost of increased CPU usage.

Show Options
------------

*Show Options* control how Shows behave. These options apply mostly to the Show tab.

Max Event History Size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The maximum number of events to store in the Event History. This is useful when creating and editing Shows.

Events Trigger Live Device Updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When enabled, Events that run in the Show tab also trigger :doc:`live updates <Device-Tab>` for any connected devices that have live updates enabled. This lets you run Show Events on a device without having to run a Show on the device itself, essentially using PixelMaestro Studio as a remote scheduler.
