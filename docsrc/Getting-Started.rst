Getting Started
===============

Use the *File* menu to create a new Maestro, open a Cuefile, save your changes, or exit the program. If your current Maestro has been modified, you'll be prompted to save your changes.

Saving
------

To save your Maestro, click *File* > *Save As* and enter the name of the file you want to save to. Maestro configuration files are called *Cuefiles*, and use the extension ``.pmc``. To save over an open Cuefile, click *File* > *Save*.

Opening a Cuefile
-----------------

To load a Cuefile, click *File* > *Open* and select a file with a ``.pmc`` extension. This will overwrite your current Maestro settings with the settings defined in the Cuefile. You can find several example Cuefiles `here <https://github.com/8bitbuddhist/PixelMaestro-Studio/tree/master/examples>`_.

If you don't want to completely overwrite your current Maestro, you can instead merge in a Cuefile using *File* > *Open and Merge.* This will load the Cuefile on top of your Maestro, keeping your existing settings while applying changes from the Cuefile.

Lastly, *File* > *Open to Event History* loads each action stored in a Cuefile and adds it to the Event History in the :doc:`Show tab <Show-Tab>`. This is useful for creating :doc:`Shows <Show-Tab>`.

Changing Preferences
--------------------

To change the appearance and behavior of PixelMaestro Studio, click :doc:`Edit > Preferences <Preferences>`. Open the :doc:`Preferences documentation <Preferences>` for more information.

Changing Output Displays
------------------------

By default, PixelMaestro Studio renders your Maestro to the main screen. You can change this by opening the *Window* menu and toggling each output device. *Main Window* displays the Maestro in the current window, while *Detached Window* opens a second independent window.

Accessing Documentation
-----------------------
