# Changelog
All notable changes to PixelMaestro Studio will be documented in this file.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [v0.9] - In Progress
### Added
- Added frame controls to Canvas editing tools.
- Added Canvas Edit mode, which stops the Canvas from animating so you can draw on individual frames.
- Added Show Edit mode, which lets you generate Events without changing the Maestro itself.

### Changed
- Revamped all Animation Editor controls. Controls are now grouped in tabs for each component: Section, Animation, Canvas, and Show.
- Show controls are now fully functional.
