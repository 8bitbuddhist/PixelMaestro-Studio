Getting Started
===============

Opening the Program
-------------------

When you first open PixelMaestro Studio, the main window opens and displays a blank Maestro. You can use the controls on the bottom half of the window to interact with the Maestro, enable/disable different PixelMaestro features, manage USB devices, and more.

Saving
------

To save a Maestro, click *File* > *Save As* and enter the name of the file you want to save to. This is known as a *Cuefile*, and it ends in the extension ".pmc". To save over a previously opened Cuefile, click *File* > *Save*.

Loading
-------

To load a previously saved Maestro, click *File* > *Open* and select a file with a ``.pmc`` extension. This will overwrite your current Maestro with the Maestro saved in the Cuefile. You can find several example Cuefiles `here <https://github.com/8bitbuddhist/PixelMaestro-Studio/tree/master/examples>`_.

You can also merge the configuration stored in a Cuefile into your current Maestro using *File* > *Open and Merge.* This will keep your current Maestro, but will apply or overwrite any configurations stored in the Cuefile.

Finally, *File* > *Open to Event History* loads a Cuefile to the Event History in the :doc:`Show tab <Show-Tab>`.

Changing Preferences
--------------------

To change the appearance and behavior of PixelMaestro Studio, click :doc:`Edit > Preferences <Preferences>`. Open the :doc:`Preferences documentation <Preferences>` for more information.

Changing Output Displays
------------------------

By default, PixelMaestro Studio renders your Maestro in the top half of the application. You can change this by opening the *Window* menu and toggling each output device. *Main Window* displays the Maestro in the current window, while *Detached Window* opens a second window.
