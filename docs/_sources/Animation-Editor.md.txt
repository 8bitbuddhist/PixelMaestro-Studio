# Animation Editor

The Animation Editor is an interactive tool for modifying a [Maestro](https://github.com/8bitbuddhist/PixelMaestro/wiki/Cues). Here you can set Animations, draw Canvases, connect USB devices, and more.

## Layout

The Animation Editor is split into two sections: the _Maestro Viewer_, and the _Maestro Editor_.

### Maestro Viewer

The top half of the Animation Editor renders the output of the Maestro. Each Section is displayed in order from left to right. The Section that currently has focus (the _Active Section_) is displayed with a white border. If a Layer is the Active Section, then the Section is displayed with a light gray border. Inactive sections have no border.

**Note**: The Maestro Viewer may not be visible if _Main Window_ is not selected as an output in the [Preferences](Preferences) screen.

### Maestro Editor

The Maestro Editor is the bottom half of the Animation Editor. It provides controls for editing the Maestro. It's divided into five tabs:

- [Section Tab](Section-Tab)
- [Animation Tab](Animation-Tab)
- [Canvas Tab](Canvas-Tab)
- [Show Tab](Show-Tab)
- [Device Tab](Device-Tab)

#### Control Buttons

At the top of the Maestro Editor are four buttons:

The _Lock Button_ prevents any actions you perform from modifying the Maestro. However, it does not prevent actions from generating [events](#show-tab). While the Maestro is locked, a padlock icon appears next to each tab and group of controls that is locked. Certain Maestro-level actions, such as enabling or disabling a [Show](#show-tab), will remain unlocked.

The _Play/Pause Button_ lets you start or stop playback of the Maestro at any time. This also stops any Show timers, Animations, and communications with USB devices.

The _Sync Button_ resets any and all timers. This synchronizes Animations, Shows, and other timer-based components.

The *Refresh Button* updates all controls with the current Maestro configuration. This is used to synchronize the UI with the Maestro when the Maestro is changed by another process (e.g. a Show). If another process changes the Maestro and the UI is left out of sync, this button appears highlighted.
