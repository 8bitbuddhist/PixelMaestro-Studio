Getting Started
===============

Opening the Program
-------------------

When you first open PixelMaestro Studio, the main window opens and displays a blank Maestro. You can use the controls provided on the screen to modify the Maestro. The top menu lets you perform global actions such as loading a Maestro, saving, editing preferences, and closing the program.

To create a new Maestro, click *File* > *New*. If your current Maestro has been modified, you'll be prompted to discard your changes.

Saving
------

To save your Maestro, click *File* > *Save As* and enter the name of the file you want to save to. Maestro configuration files are called *Cuefiles* and use the extension ".pmc". To save over a Cuefile that's currently opened, click *File* > *Save*.

Loading
-------

To load a Cuefile, click *File* > *Open* and select a file with a ``.pmc`` extension. This will overwrite your current Maestro with the Maestro defined in the Cuefile. You can find several example Cuefiles `here <https://github.com/8bitbuddhist/PixelMaestro-Studio/tree/master/examples>`_.

You can also merge the configuration stored in a Cuefile into your current Maestro using *File* > *Open and Merge.* This will keep your current Maestro, but will apply and/or overwrite any settings defined in the Cuefile.

Finally, *File* > *Open to Event History* loads a Cuefile to the Event History in the :doc:`Show tab <Show-Tab>`.

Changing Preferences
--------------------

To change the appearance and behavior of PixelMaestro Studio, click :doc:`Edit > Preferences <Preferences>`. Open the :doc:`Preferences documentation <Preferences>` for more information.

Changing Output Displays
------------------------

By default, PixelMaestro Studio renders your Maestro to the main screen. You can change this by opening the *Window* menu and toggling each output device. *Main Window* displays the Maestro in the current window, while *Detached Window* opens a second independent window.
