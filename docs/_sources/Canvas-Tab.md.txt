# Canvas Tab

The Canvas tab lets you create and customize [Canvases](https://github.com/8bitbuddhist/PixelMaestro/tree/master/docs/Canvases.html). Canvases let you draw shapes, load images, and even create custom animations.

To add a Canvas to the active Section, click _Enable Canvas_.

Like Animations, Canvases use color palettes. The same palettes can be used for both components. However, Canvases are limited to the first 255 colors in a palette, since the last color is reserved for transparency.

**Tip:** To reapply a Palette after customizing it, simply reselect it from the drop-down.

## Loading Images

You can load an image file into the Canvas by clicking the _Load Image..._ button. You can select a PNG, JPEG, or GIF image file. If the image is animated, you can control its playback using the _Animation Tools_ controls.

## Drawing

Drawing on a Canvas works similar to a normal image editor. You select the drawing tool you wish to use, select the location where you want to draw, select your colors and any additional parameters, then click the `Draw` button.  When [free drawing](#free-drawing), you can even draw directly on the Canvas using the mouse.

## Drawing Tools

The _Drawing Tools_ box provides controls for drawing on the the Canvas. Select a drawing tool using the icons on the left-hand side of the box. Depending on the tool you select, one or more text boxes will become enabled. These boxes require you to specify the coordinates, size, or other options needed to create the shape.

**Tip:** You can use the brush tool to [free draw](#free-drawing) directly on the Canvas using your mouse.

When drawing shapes, only the outline of the shape is drawn by default. Checking _Fill_ draws the shape filled in.

You will need to select a color before drawing a shape. Select a Palette using the _Color Palette_ drop-down. Then, click on the color you want to use to set it as the drawing color. To clear a pixel, click the **X** button at the far left of the color list. This sets the active color to transparent. You can "draw" using this transparent color in order to erase parts of the Canvas.

**Tip:** Canvases have access to the same Palettes as Animations, but they can only use a maximum of 255 colors. Technically they support 256 colors, but the last color is reserved for transparency.

### Specifying Coordinates

When drawing a shape, you will need to specify where you want to draw the shape. Canvases use a standard [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) with the origin (0,0) starting in the top-left corner and increasing as you move away from the corner. For example, the point (2, 5) is 2 pixels to the right of the origin and 5 pixels down.

The coordinate boxes are found on the right-hand side of the Drawing Tools box:

* The _Cursor_ is the shape's starting point. For rectangles and text this is the top-left corner, but for circles this is the center.
* The _Target_ is the shape's ending point.
  * For lines and rectangles, this is the opposite point from the origin.
  * For circles, this is the _radius_.
  * For triangles, this is the location of the triangle's second corner.
* For triangles, _Target 2_ is the location of the triangle's third corner.

### Free Drawing

You can draw directly onto a Canvas by selecting the brush icon, selecting a color, and left-clicking directly on the Section. Use the right mouse button to erase, which sets the current pixel's color to transparent.

You can also click on the Section with the [replace tool](#replacing-colors) selected to choose which color to replace.

### Replacing Colors

You can replace a particular color with another color by using the *Replace* tool. The Replace tool replaces all instances of one color across the entire frame with another color. Select the pixel containing the color you want to replace, select the new color in the Palette, then click *Draw*. You can also select the color by left-clicking directly on the Section.

## Managing Animations

The _Animation Tools_ box contains controls for managing and editing animations. Any Canvas with more than one drawing surface (called a _frame_) is an animated Canvas.  _Frame Count_ displays the total number of frames, while _Current Frame_ displays the index of the current frame (while the animation is stopped). You can start or stop playback and step through frames using the playback buttons. _Frame Interval_ sets the amount of time (in milliseconds) between each frame.

**Tip:** Use the arrow keys to step through individual frames while the animation is paused.

## Clearing the Canvas

To erase the Canvas, click the _Clear..._ button.

**WARNING:** This will erase _every_ frame in the Canvas!
