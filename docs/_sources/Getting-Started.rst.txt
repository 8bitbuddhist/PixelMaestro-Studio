Getting Started
===============

Opening the Program
-------------------

When you first open PixelMaestro Studio, the main window opens and displays a blank Maestro. You can use the controls at the bottom of the screen to edit the Maestro, enable Animations or Canvases, or connect to USB devices.

Saving
------

Maestros can be saved to files on your computer. These are known as *Cuefiles*. To save to a new Cuefile, click *File* > *Save As* and enter a filename. To save over a previously opened Cuefile, click *File* > *Save*.

Loading
-------

To open a Cuefile over your existing configuration, click *File* > *Open* and select a file with a ``.pmc`` extnesion. You can find several example Cuefiles `here <https://github.com/8bitbuddhist/PixelMaestro-Studio/tree/master/examples>`_.

You can also load a Cuefile into your existing configuration using *File* > *Open and Merge.* This won't replace your current configuration, but will instead merge the Cuefile into your session.

Finally, *File* > *Open to Event History* loads the Cuefile to the Event History in the :doc:`Show tab <Show-Tab>`. This is useful for creating Shows from existing files.

Changing Preferences
--------------------

To change the apperance and behavior of PixelMaestro Studio, click :doc:`Edit > Preferences <Preferences>`.

Changing Output Displays
------------------------

By default, PixelMaestro Studio renders your Maestro to the top half of the window. You can change this by opening the *Window* menu and either enabling or disabling an output device. *Main Window* toggles output to the window, while *Detached Window* toggles a second window.

Accessing Documentation
-----------------------

If you need help, click *File* > *Help* to access the online wiki and other documentation resources.
